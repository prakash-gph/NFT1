          <h2>ABOUT THE ORGANISATION:</h2>

          <p><FcAbout /> Bharat's culture is the lifeblood of the nation. It is evident that to protect Bharat, we must <br></br>first nourish its culture.
            If Bharat's culture fades away within its borders, and if Hindu <br></br>society ceases to exist, it would be inappropriate
            to refer to the mere <br></br>geographical entity that remains as Bharat-India.</p>

          <p><FcAbout /> Geographical boundaries alone do not constitute a nation. It is essential for society to be vigilant <br></br>and organized
            so that no one would dare to undermine our values and honor. Strength arises<br></br> from organization. Therefore,
            it is the duty of every individual to contribute to the<br></br> consolidation of Bharat's society.</p>

          <p><FcAbout /> To develop and nurture an appreciation of Indian arts and culture through
            educational<br></br> programmes, cultural orientation programmes, and outreach
            activities for children and<br></br> young people.</p>
